' MODULE: KPR_Core_Array
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Internal boundary for input shape: classifying an argument's shape and
'   unwrapping a single-valued wrapper down to the scalar it carries.
'
' WHY THIS EXISTS
'   The pre-split baseline mixed three concerns inside Parse_Date: unwrapping
'   shape, converting a scalar to a Date, and gating the supported window.
'   Shape lives here, value conversion lives in KPR_Core_Parse, and the window
'   belongs to the calendar domain in KPR_Core_Dates. Separating them is what
'   allows the array engine in issue #16 to traverse shapes without duplicating
'   value parsing.
'
' SCOPE
'   Shape services for the single public surface (issue #16):
'
'   - Array_Rank          true array rank, 0 through 60
'   - TryUnwrapScalar     single-cell Range and 1x1 array unwrapping (scalar path)
'   - TryUnwrapControl    the same for Opt_ controls, reporting CONTROL_NOT_SCALAR
'                         for a valid multi-element shape without reading it
'   - TryClassifyShape    classify one argument from type and dimensions alone
'   - CheckCapacity       Rows x Cols <= 100,000, computed in Double
'   - TryMaterialize      classify, gate capacity, then snapshot one argument
'                         into a scalar or a 1-based 2-D payload
'   - AccumulateShape     fold one argument's shape into the output shape
'   - ElementAt           the element at a position; total over a valid descriptor
'   - TryAllocateOutput   a 1-based 2-D output of a validated shape
'
'   The engine owns shape classification, broadcast resolution, allocation and
'   unwrapping ONLY. It contains no date algorithm, never classifies the host,
'   and performs no function-pointer dispatch: VBA has no clean way to call an
'   element implementation from here, so the per-element loop lives in the
'   facade (#17) and calls these services. #16 changes no public behaviour.
'
' ORDER OF OPERATIONS THE FACADE MUST KEEP
'   1. PassHostGuard first. A Range in a 1904 workbook must be refused BEFORE
'      it is materialized: once Value2 has been read, its serials are in hand
'      and nothing downstream can tell they meant something else. The engine
'      never sees the guard by design, so this ordering is the facade's duty
'      and #17 depends on it.
'   2. TryClassifyShape EVERY value argument, so an unsupported shape anywhere
'      in the argument list is reported before anything else.
'   3. Resolve Opt_ controls with TryUnwrapControl, which never reads the
'      contents of a multi-element control, and AccumulateShape across the
'      classified arguments (SHAPE_MISMATCH).
'   4. CheckCapacity once, on the resolved output shape. Only now may content
'      be read.
'   5. TryMaterialize each value argument (its internal gate is a defence that
'      cannot fire differently, since every array matched the gated shape),
'      then TryAllocateOutput.
'   6. Traverse row-major: R = 1 To Rows, C = 1 To Cols. Traversal is
'      deterministic and touches no Excel state.
'
'   This is contract section 5.2's order. A jagged array is the one shape
'   rejection reported after the capacity gate, because detecting it requires
'   inspecting elements.
'
' SHAPE VOCABULARY
'   KPR_SHAPE_SCALAR   a scalar, a single-cell Range or a 1x1 array; expands to
'                      every output position
'   KPR_SHAPE_ARRAY    a Rows x Cols payload with Rows or Cols above 1
'
'   A one-dimensional VBA array is 1xN. Worksheet Range orientation is
'   preserved. All non-scalar arguments must match exactly; there is no
'   row-to-column outer product and no implicit cross-broadcast. A multi-area,
'   zero-element, jagged or rank-3+ input and any non-Range object are
'   SHAPE_UNSUPPORTED.
'
' RANK
'   Rank is reported rather than capped, so a caller can reject a shape it does
'   not support at its own boundary. Folding rank 3 and above into rank 2 would
'   let such an array reach code that indexes it with two subscripts, raising
'   error 9 inside the caller instead of failing cleanly here.
'
' TYPE HANDOFF
'   A single-cell Range is read through Value2, so a date-formatted cell leaves
'   this module as vbDouble rather than the vbDate that a Value read produces.
'
'   Nothing downstream depends on which of the two arrives: KPR_Core_Parse
'   resolves both through the same arithmetic path and returns the same
'   date-only result, verified on the host. Value2 is used because it applies
'   no Date or Currency coercion of its own, not because the parse layer
'   requires it.
'
'   What does matter is that the argument is never Let-copied before its type
'   is tested. A Let assignment from a Variant holding an object invokes that
'   object's default member, which for a Range is Value. That silently turns a
'   wrapper into a value before any shape test runs, which makes the non-Range
'   rejection unreachable except through error 438 and materializes a
'   multi-cell Range in full before CountLarge can reject it.
'
' VISIBILITY
'   Option Private Module. Members are declared Public so other modules in the
'   project can call them; the module-level Private setting is what keeps them
'   out of the Excel function list and off the project's external surface.
'   Nothing here is supported API.
'
' ALLOWED DEPENDENCIES
'   KPR_Core_Err, for the condition vocabulary. No member raises; every
'   failure is a return value with a classified condition.
'
' PURITY
'   The static gate forbids in this module: UsedRange, Select, Activate,
'   Calculate, EnableEvents, ScreenUpdating, Selection, Application.Caller,
'   AddressOf, CallByName, Application.Run, and the date intrinsics
'   DateSerial, DateValue, CDate, Weekday, Year, Month and Day. A shape engine
'   that reads calendar values or Excel state has stopped being a shape engine.

'
'==============================================================================
'                                  Array_Rank
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Reports how many dimensions an array payload actually exposes.
'
' WHY THIS EXISTS
'   Callers must reject any shape they do not support, and VBA offers no
'   non-raising way to ask. Keeping the probe here means no caller has to
'   hold its own On Error Resume Next block.
'
'   Reporting true rank rather than a capped classification lets a caller
'   reject rank 3 and above at its own boundary. Folding 3D into 2D would
'   let such an array through to be indexed with two subscripts, raising
'   error 9 deep inside the caller instead.
'
' SIGNATURE
'   Array_Rank(ArrayIn) -> Long
'
' INPUTS
'   ArrayIn
'     Variant that may or may not hold an array payload. Never written to.
'
' RETURNS
'   Long
'     0  => non-array, or dynamic array that has never been ReDim'd
'     1  => 1D array, including an empty one returned by Array()
'     2  => 2D array
'     3+ => rank as declared, up to the VBA ceiling of 60
'
' ERROR POLICY
'   - Does NOT raise.
'   - Clears Err as a side effect; callers must not hold pending error
'     state across this call.
'   - Restores normal error handling for the remainder of THIS procedure
'     only. VBA scopes error state per procedure, so the caller's handler
'     is unaffected either way.
'
' NOTES
'   - Any result >= 1 guarantees LBound / UBound are safe for dimensions
'     1 to that value. No caller-side guard is required.
'   - Rank 0 covers both "not an array" and "array with no allocated
'     dimensions". Callers needing to separate these should use IsArray,
'     which does not raise.
'   - A jagged array is rank 1. Its elements being arrays is not visible
'     here.
'   - The probe is bounded at the VBA ceiling of 60 dimensions so that a
'     payload whose probe never fails cannot spin.
'   - ProbeBound is assigned and never read. It exists because LBound must
'     have a destination; only the success or failure of the call matters.
'     Removing it breaks the probe.

Public Function TryUnwrapScalar( _

    As Boolean
'
'==============================================================================
'                                TryUnwrapScalar
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Reduces an incoming argument to the single scalar it carries, or fails.
'
' WHY THIS EXISTS
'   Worksheet arguments arrive as scalars, as single-cell Range objects, or as
'   1x1 array wrappers depending on how the formula was written. All three mean
'   one value. This routine is the single place that decides which wrappers are
'   equivalent to a scalar, so no caller re-implements shape logic.
'
' SIGNATURE
'   TryUnwrapScalar(ValueIn, ScalarOut) -> Boolean
'
' INPUTS
'   ValueIn
'     Any Variant argument, including Range objects and arrays.
'
' OUTPUTS
'   ScalarOut (ByRef)
'     Assigned ONLY on success, to the unwrapped scalar payload.
'
' RETURNS
'   Boolean
'     TRUE  => a single scalar was extracted; ScalarOut assigned
'     FALSE => the input is not single-valued; ScalarOut untouched
'
' BEHAVIOR
'   - An object is accepted only when it is a Range of exactly one cell, read
'     through Value2.
'   - An array is accepted only when it is rank 1 or rank 2 and holds exactly
'     one element. Rank 0 and rank 3 or higher are rejected outright.
'   - A single element that is itself an object is rejected; it is a wrapper,
'     not a scalar payload.
'   - Anything else, including a multi-cell Range and a non-Range object, fails.
'   - The scalar payload is NOT inspected here. Type acceptance is owned by
'     KPR_Core_Parse.
'
' ERROR POLICY
'   - Does not raise. All failure paths return FALSE.
'   - Clears Err before returning FALSE, so no stale error state survives.
'
' DEPENDENCIES
'   - Array_Rank
'
' NOTES
'   - ValueIn is tested with IsObject directly and never Let-copied first. See
'     TYPE HANDOFF in the module header for what a Let copy would do.
'   - Rank is tested before any bound is read, so an unsupported shape is
'     rejected at the boundary rather than through the error handler.
'   - The wrapped-object rejection is a guard rather than a migrated rule. The
'     baseline had no equivalent, because its own Let copy meant an object
'     element was dereferenced before anything could test it.
'   - Rejecting a multi-element input is the baseline's scalar-only contract,
'     migrated unchanged. Issue #16 replaces rejection with traversal; this
'     routine keeps its meaning and becomes the 1x1 case of that engine.

' PURPOSE
'   Classifies one value argument from its type and dimensions ALONE: no

'
' WHY THIS EXISTS
'   Contract section 5.2 orders the call-level stages: shape classification of
'   every argument, then control validation and broadcast resolution, then the
'   capacity gate, then traversal. A service that classified and gated in one
'   step could report CAPACITY_EXCEEDED for the first argument before a later
'   argument's SHAPE_UNSUPPORTED or a SHAPE_MISMATCH had been seen. This
'   preflight lets the facade classify everything first and gate once, on the
'   resolved output shape.

'   Rows/Cols (ByRef)  the argument's dimensions; 1 x 1 for a scalar
'   Condition (ByRef)  always assigned
'
' BEHAVIOR
'   - A Variant holding a Range is never Let-assigned before its type is tested.
'   - A single-area Range reports its Rows and Columns counts. A one-cell Range
'     is a scalar. Value2 is NOT read.
'   - A rank-1 array is 1 x N; a rank-2 array reports its bounds; a one-element
'     array is a scalar. No element is read.
'   - A multi-area Range, a zero-element array, a rank above 2 and any
'     non-Range object are SHAPE_UNSUPPORTED.
'   - A jagged array cannot be detected here, because detecting it requires
'     inspecting elements and that is forbidden before the capacity gate. It is
'     detected by TryMaterialize and reported as SHAPE_UNSUPPORTED then. The
'     contract records this as the one shape rejection that follows capacity.

'                                TryMaterialize
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Classifies one value argument, gates its capacity, and snapshots it into a
'   payload the engine can index: the scalar itself, or a 1-based 2-D Variant.
'
' SIGNATURE
'   TryMaterialize(ValueIn, Payload, Kind, Rows, Cols, Condition) -> Boolean
'
' OUTPUTS
'   Payload   (ByRef)  assigned ONLY on success
'   Kind      (ByRef)  KPR_SHAPE_SCALAR or KPR_SHAPE_ARRAY
'   Rows/Cols (ByRef)  the argument's dimensions; 1 x 1 for a scalar
'   Condition (ByRef)  always assigned
'
' BEHAVIOR
'   - Type is tested before anything is copied. A Variant holding a Range is
'     never Let-assigned; that would invoke Range.Value and materialize the
'     whole Range before capacity or area count could be checked.
'   - A single-area Range reports Rows and Cols from the Range object, is
'     capacity-gated, and only THEN read once through Value2. A one-cell Range
'     is a scalar. Value2 is used as supplied: no UsedRange intersection, no
'     trimming, no per-cell reads.
'   - A 2-D VBA array reports its bounds, is capacity-gated, then normalized to
'     a 1-based copy. A 1-D array becomes 1 x N the same way. A one-element
'     array is a scalar.
'   - Elements are inspected only during the normalizing copy, which happens
'     after the gate. An element that is itself an array makes the input
'     jagged: SHAPE_UNSUPPORTED.
'   - Empty, Null and error elements are preserved at their positions. The
'     engine does not interpret them; #17 parses per element.
'   - A multi-area Range, a zero-element array, a rank above 2, and any
'     non-Range object are SHAPE_UNSUPPORTED.
'
' ERROR POLICY
'   - Does not raise. Every failure path returns FALSE with a condition.
