## 🧭 Change classification

- [ ] Defect correction
- [ ] Backward-compatible capability
- [ ] Breaking API, behavior, deployment, or migration change
- [ ] Internal refactor with no intended supported-behavior change
- [ ] Test, fixture, reference-data, or validation change
- [ ] Performance change
- [ ] Security or trust-boundary hardening
- [ ] Documentation-only change
- [ ] Repository tooling, workflow, or governance change
- [ ] Packaging or release preparation
- [ ] Date, calendar, day-count, or schedule change
- [ ] Rate, curve, cash-flow, instrument, or pricing change
- [ ] Numerical method, solver, or approximation change

## 🎚️ Affected surface

- [ ] Worksheet UDF or VBA caller surface
- [ ] Public result or error contract
- [ ] Date/calendar/schedule foundation
- [ ] Pricing, curve, cash-flow, or instrument engine
- [ ] Array classification, broadcasting, or traversal
- [ ] Excel host integration or application state
- [ ] No runtime or supported surface — documentation/repository-only

## 📐 Scope and contract impact

### In scope

- <!-- Deliberate outcome -->

### Out of scope

- <!-- Reasonable adjacent work deliberately deferred -->

### Supported behavior and compatibility

```text
Supported behavior changed:       Yes / No
Backward compatible:              Yes / No / Uncertain
Suggested release impact:         none / patch / minor / major / uncertain
New supported members:
Removed or renamed members:
Changed signatures or defaults:
Changed results, errors, state, or side effects:
Migration required:
Known limitation introduced or retained:
```

Assess compatibility against documented behavior, not merely the VBA `Public` keyword. Infrastructure callbacks, Ribbon entry points, test seams, and `Application.Run` targets are not automatically supported API.

### Production source and package

The source manifest and import order documented in `INSTALLATION.md`, including the public `KPR_DATES_DAYS` facade and required `KPR_Core_*` modules.

- [ ] Required source files and import order are unchanged.
- [ ] Required source files or order changed and `INSTALLATION.md` was updated.
- [ ] No production source/package impact.

## 🔧 Implementation notes

```text
Approach and key invariant:
Alternatives considered:
New dependency, reference, or generated input:
State ownership and cleanup:
Failure behavior:

Explain decisions a future reviewer cannot safely infer from the diff.

## ✅ Verification

### Candidate identity

| Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Exact PR HEAD SHA | <!-- Full 40-character SHA --> |
| Base branch and base SHA | <!-- Branch + full SHA --> |
| Working tree used locally | <!-- clean / dirty; explain --> |
| Source or package tested | <!-- Exact candidate source / artifact / N/A --> |

Evidence from another commit does not certify this candidate.

### Static and repository checks

- `python3 tools/check_repo.py --root . --self-test`
- `python3 tools/check_repo.py`
- `git diff --check`

| Check | Result / evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Hosted required checks | <!-- PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN + workflow URL --> |
| Local static command | <!-- Command + PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN --> |
| Formatting / `git diff --check` | <!-- PASS / FAIL --> |
| Machine-readable artifact | <!-- Name / URL / not produced --> |

### Excel and VBA execution

- [ ] Required and completed against the exact PR HEAD.
- [ ] Required but incomplete — reason and merge/release consequence stated.
- [ ] Not required — documentation/repository-only change with no executable or packaging impact.

Relevant entry points:

- `KPR_Tests_RunAll` or the documented complete KPR suite
- Focused public-surface and worksheet smoke tests

| Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tested commit SHA | <!-- Full SHA or N/A --> |
| `Debug → Compile VBAProject` | <!-- PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN / N/A --> |
| Regression/certification entry point | <!-- Exact procedure --> |
| Completion state | <!-- PASS / FAIL / INCOMPLETE / NOT RUN --> |
| Cases / assertions / failures | <!-- Counts or N/A --> |
| Skipped / cleanup outcome | <!-- Counts and state or N/A --> |
| Focused and manual checks | <!-- Scenarios + result --> |
| Evidence file or workflow | <!-- Name / URL / N/A --> |

### Validation environment

```text
Excel product, version, and build:
Office bitness:                    32-bit / 64-bit
Windows version/build:
Workbook or add-in host:
Deployment model:
Workbook date system: 1900 / 1904
Locale and decimal/list separators
Dynamic-array Excel availability where spill behavior changes
```

Record only tested environments. Source inspection does not constitute host execution, and one Office bitness does not execute the other conditional branch.

### Regression coverage

- [ ] Existing tests cover the changed success path.
- [ ] New or amended tests cover each corrected defect.
- [ ] Boundary, invalid-input, failure, fallback, and cleanup paths are covered as applicable.
- [ ] Test entry points and inventory/count metadata remain synchronized.
- [ ] Expected results come from the contract or an independent reference.
- [ ] No regression change is needed — rationale recorded below.

## ⚠️ Risk, rollback, and recovery

- [ ] Low — documentation, metadata, or mechanically verified change.
- [ ] Medium — bounded runtime, tooling, or compatibility impact.
- [ ] High — numerical integrity, shared Excel state, native API, security, release, or breaking impact.

```text
Principal failure modes:
Residual risk after validation:
Rollback or revert procedure:
Excel-process, workbook, data, or artifact recovery:
Conditions that make rollback unsafe:

## 🔐 Security, data, and provenance

- [ ] No credential, secret, signing material, internal URL, or personal path is included.
- [ ] No client, employer, counterparty, student, personal, or restricted production data is included.
- [ ] Test data is synthetic, anonymized, or explicitly redistributable.
- [ ] External algorithms, code, datasets, and market/vendor data have attributable provenance and compatible licensing.
- [ ] Formula, command, path, callback, deserialization, and external-content injection surfaces were assessed.
- [ ] No security-sensitive detail belongs in private disclosure instead of this pull request.
- [ ] Generated evidence identifies its inputs, tool/runtime version, candidate SHA, and limitations.

```text
Security or privacy impact:
Source/data provenance:
New trust boundary:
```

## 📚 Documentation and release hygiene

- [ ] `README.md` reflects supported behavior and examples.
- [ ] `INSTALLATION.md` reflects paths, dependencies, import order, validation, upgrades, and removal.
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` reflects development and evidence requirements.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` records material change under `[Unreleased]`.
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` reflects supported versions or trust boundaries.
- [ ] `RELEASING.md` reflects certification, package, provenance, or recovery changes.
- [ ] Source headers, API references, demos, Wiki pages, and counts remain synchronized.
- [ ] Version markers remain unchanged unless this is the deliberate release-stamp change.
- [ ] No documentation change is required — reason recorded below.

<details>
<summary><strong>💹 Financial and numerical contract</strong></summary>

Complete this block whenever the change can alter a date, amount, rate, price, curve, probability, schedule, or diagnostic.

```

- [ ] Every material convention is explicit rather than inferred from locale or formatting.
- [ ] Strict input rejection and error precedence remain deterministic.
- [ ] Scalar, single-cell, array, Range, and spill/broadcast behavior are covered as applicable.
- [ ] Capacity limits are decided before content is read.
- [ ] The 1900/1904 host-date-system contract is preserved or deliberately revised.
